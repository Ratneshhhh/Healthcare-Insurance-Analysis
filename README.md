# Health Insurance Claim Analysis

A comprehensive project to analyze and predict health insurance claim patterns using Power BI and Python. The project includes end-to-end data processing, regression-based modeling, and interactive dashboards for business reporting.

## 🔍 Objective
To evaluate factors influencing insurance claim amounts and build a reporting tool to help identify potential risk profiles based on user behavior, demographics, and medical conditions.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Healthinsurance PowerBI Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization.
- `Healthcare Insurance Claim Analysis Project.ipynb`: Python notebook for EDA and model building.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (you are here).

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
- Average claim analysis by:
  - **BMI category**
  - **Smoking status**
  - **Diabetes**
  - **Hereditary diseases**
  - **Age group**
- Gender-based claim comparison
- Key metrics: average claim amount, claim count, average weight, BP, age
- Filters: exercise habits, gender, smoking, diabetes

## 🧮 Python Modeling (Notebook)
- Cleaned and transformed raw insurance data
- Applied **Random Forest Regression** to predict claim amounts
- Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R²
- Feature engineering to assess risk factors

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (dashboard & KPIs)
- **Python (Pandas, Sklearn)** for data modeling
- **Excel** (initial data exploration)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for model building

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Obese individuals** show the highest average claim amounts.
- **Smokers** and those with **diabetes** or **hereditary conditions** are high-risk categories.
- Claims increase with age and are higher among **senior adults**.
- Gender impact is relatively balanced but varies across conditions.

## ✅ Outcome
Enabled stakeholders to:
- Identify risk-prone groups based on data trends.
- Support policy customization based on health factors.
- Generate personalized insights using user-level filters.
